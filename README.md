Kickstart My Chart Written Answers
By: Michael Matheson

1.	In general, Kickstarterâ€™s asking for less money tend to have higher success rates, most failed Kickstarters do not have any money promised to them, theater is the most popular category of Kickstarter.
2.	Average donation is in different units because they are recorded in different currencies, so they are not directly comparable. 
3.	Compare success rates between staff picks and non staff picks or between those spotlighted or not to see if it has a positive or negative effect and how large that effect is. 

Bonus:
1.	I think the median does a better job of measuring central tendency of the number of backers because of the rather large skewness of the data. 
2.	There is more variability among successful campaigns, this makes sense because a lot of the unsuccessful kickstarters tend to have zero backers, as well as less backers in general because they did not reach their goal.
